# Grand Theft Blank 

GT_ is a cooperative and inclusive space aimed at providing room for shared infrastructure and interdiciplinary discourse to its members.
Its subject matter lies mainly in science, technology and the arts but will shift with the interests of its users.

In principle its governance and management are the responsibility of its long-term members (who also pay the rent) with the consideration to hold the autonomy of its users and their ability to contribute or produce as paramount.

GT_ is open for specific public events (talks, workshops, parties, etc.) but normally operates on an invite-only basis (meaning a social connection to an already established member has to exist in order to use the space).
