# Grand Theft Blank 

GT_ is a cooperative and inclusive space aimed at providing room for shared infrastructure and interdisciplinary discourse.
Currently it focuses mainly on science, technology and the arts but this can shift with the interests of its users. 

In principle, it is governed and managed by its long-term members (who also pay the rent) with the consideration to hold the autonomy of its users and their ability to contribute or produce as paramount.

Under normal operation GT_  is a space for its members and their friends, but it is open for specific public events such as talks, workshops, parties and so on. Please be respectful of the space and the people in it.
