# Grand Theft Blank 

GT_ is a cooperative and inclusive space aimed at providing room for shared infrastructure and interdiciplinary discourse to it's members.
It's subject matter lies mainly in science, technology and the arts but will shift with the interests of it's users.
In principle it's governance and management are the responsibilitiy of it's long-term members (whoo also pay the rent) with the consideration to hold the autonomy of it's users and their ability to contribute or produce as paramount.
GT_ is open for specific public events (talks, workshops, parties, etc.) but normally operates on an invite-only basis (meaning a social connection to an already established member has to be exist in order to use the space).
